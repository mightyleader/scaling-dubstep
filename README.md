UK Lottery Number generator
===========================

The national lottery in the UK kindly provides history of the last 180 lottery drawers in CSV format in the draw history section of each game.
As a way to learn a bit of Python, I ran up a quick script to parse the files recevied (without any editing of them beforehand) to output the most and least drawn numbers.

The script parses two files, examples of which are provided, for the Lotto and EuroMillions games.

The script outputs main numbers only not Bonus Ball (for Lotto) or Lucky Star (for EuroMillions) draws.
That's the next step :)
